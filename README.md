The SInteliGIS Temporal Expression Tagger (stemptag) is a Java-based system addressing the complete resolution of temporal expressions given over textual documents, through the usage of Machine Learning (ML) approaches. This resolution involves recognizing the temporal expressions, i.e. delimiting their occurrences over the textual documents, and normalizing the recognized expressions, i.e. explicitly associating the text chunks to calendar points or calendar intervals.

In the past, temporal expression - or timex - recognition has been attempted with both human-generated rules and ML-based approaches, with both working reasonably well. However, the timex normalization problem has mostly been addressed through the usage of human-made rules. For more information about previous works on handling temporal expressions in text, please refer to the TIMEXPortal or the TimeML websites.

The stemptag system is being developed in the context of the SInteliGIS project financed by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through project grant PTDC/EIA-EIA/109840/2009.
